In: <i>Proceedings of the 1994 ACM conference on LISP and functional programming</i>, 1994, pp. 185–195<div class="bibBlurb"><p>Lists are ubiquitous in functional programs, thus supporting lists efficiently is a major concern to compiler writers for functional languages. Lists are normally represented as linked <i>cons</i> cells, with each <i>cons</i> cell containing a <i>car</i> (the data) and a <i>cdr</i> (the link); this is inefficient in the use of space, because 50% of the storage is used for links. Loops and recursions on lists are slow on modern machines because of the long chains of control dependence (in checking for <i>nil</i>) and data dependence (in fetching <i>cdr</i> fields).</p><p>We present a data structure for “unrolled lists,” where each cell has several data items (<i>car</i> fields) and one link (<i>cdr</i>). This reduces the memory used for links, and it significantly shortens the length of control-dependence and data-dependence chains in operations on lists.</p><p>We further present an efficient compile-time analysis that transforms programs written for “ordinary” lists into programs on unrolled lists. The use of our new representation requires no change to existing programs.</p><p>We sketch the proof of soundness of our analysis—which is based on <i>refinement</i> types—and present some preliminary measurements of our technique.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
